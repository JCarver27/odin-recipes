    <h3>Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Coffee Cake</h3>
    <p>A friend of mine gave me this recipe years ago. Sometimes I lower the fat content by using 
        fat-free sour cream or yogurt instead of the sour cream. Enjoy! This can also be made into 
        small loaf cakes which can be frozen easily.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Coffe Cake</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch bundt pan.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The 
            mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg 
            to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Mix in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Add flour 
            mixture to batter alternately with sour cream, mixing until just incorporated after each 
            addition. Fold in walnuts. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Mix sugar and cinnamon for filling in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture over batter in the pan. Drop remaining batter in heaping 
            spoonfuls over filling, covering it as best you can.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 
            and bake for an additional 40 minutes or until a tester comes out clean.</li>
    </ol>
